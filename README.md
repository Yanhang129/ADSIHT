# ADSIHT
`ADSIHT` aims to solve the high-dimensional double sparse linear regression problem, that is, a combination of element-wise and group-wise sparsity.
In our paper, we show that our algorithm achieves the minimax optimality with fast linear convergence.

## Installation
Installation of the `ADSIHT` package can be done directly from github:
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Yanhang129/ADSIHT")
```
